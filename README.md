# Hibernate-Rest-API-Primer:

This repository demonstrates the integration of Hibernate ORM with a RESTful API using core Java technologies. It includes key examples for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database using Hibernate and exposes those functionalities through a REST API.

## Core Features:
* Set up Hibernate ORM for database interaction.
* Build and configure a RESTful API using Java and Hibernate.
* Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Hibernate entities.

## Technologies:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Hibernate ORM
* REST API

## Configuration Setup:
* Hibernate: 
	* Configure hibernate.cfg.xml for database connections, session management, and entity mapping.
* REST API: 
	* Set up API endpoints using Java, exposing Hibernate operations for client consumption.
